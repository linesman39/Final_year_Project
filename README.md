This app is used to perform an indepth analysis of the performance of multinomial and bernoulli naive bayes for SMS spam detection
The analysis sections include ->

**1. Multinomial Naive bayes**

**2. Bernoulli Naive bayes**

## Structure Of The Project

- Each prediction page is conneceted with a Machine Learning Model which uses either of multinomial or bernoulli naive bayes to predict the results.
- Also we have thesame dataset being used for each prediction.
- We can land into each prediction site of the web app from the options in the Navigation Menu.
- We have only 1 relevant feature taken into consideration which is the text and then the text is preprocessed and vectoized with help of TF-IDF Vectorizer to fit into the model and tain it.
- So the user gets a broad overview of the text after the analysis

## The feature taken into consideration

| Text Analysis Type | Feature |
| - | - |
| multinomial naive bayes Page | Text |
| bernoulli naive bayes Page | Text |


The text is preprocessed then fed to the model.

## Deployment Of The Project

After the modeling part the model is deployed using Streamlit library on Streamlit Share so that the app is available for usage for everyone.
